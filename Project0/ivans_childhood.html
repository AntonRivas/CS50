          <h4>Synopsis</h4>
          <p>Ivan's Childhood tells the story of orphaned boy Ivan, whose parents were
            killed by the invading German forces, and his experiences during World War II.
            Ivan's Childhood was one of several Soviet films of its period, such as The Cranes
            Are Flying and Ballad of a Soldier, that looked at the human cost of war and did not
            glorify the war experience as did films produced before the Khrushchev Thaw.</p>

          <h4>Reception</h4>
          <p>Ivan's Childhood was one of Tarkovsky's most commercially successful films,
            selling 16.7 million tickets in the Soviet Union.[8] Tarkovsky himself was
            displeased with some aspects of the film; in his book Sculpting in Time,
            he writes at length about subtle changes to certain scenes that he regrets not implementing</p>
